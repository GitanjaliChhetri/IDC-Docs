# Introduction

Cloud-based hosting of public cancer imaging collections is a key functionality of IDC.

Currently, IDC is hosting a [subset](https://portal.imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov/collections/) of publicly available collections from The Cancer Imaging Archive \(TCIA\).

If you would like us to prioritize an existing public TCIA collection, which is not currently included in the IDC offering, please start the discussion on our [forum](https://discourse.canceridc.dev/c/data/8)!
{% endhint %}

Check out [Data release notes](data-release-notes.md) for the information about the collections added in the individual IDC data releases.

In the following pages we discuss how to access datasets hosted by IDC and their organization.

{% hint style="info" %}
Our goal is to support you in using cloud resources for data analysis. Therefore, our documentation focuses on how to use IDC data from the cloud resources, and not from your desktop, as the latter would require downloading the data.
