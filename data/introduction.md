# Introduction

Cloud-based hosting of public cancer imaging collections is a key functionality of IDC.

Currently, IDC is hosting a subset of publicly available collections from The Cancer Imaging Archive \(TCIA\). The complete list of the collections available on IDC is available [here](https://idc-testing.appspot.com/collections/).

If you would like us to prioritize an existing public TCIA collection, which is not currently included in the IDC offering, please start the discussion on our forum [here](https://discourse.canceridc.dev/c/data/8)!

Check out [Data release notes](data-release-notes.md) for the information about the collections added in the individual IDC data releases.

In the following pages we discuss how to access datasets hosted by IDC, and their organization.
