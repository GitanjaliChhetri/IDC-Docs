# Organization of data

IDC approach to storage and management of DICOM data is relying on the Google Cloud Platform [Healthcare API](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/dicom). We maintain three representations of the data, which are fully synchronized and correspond to the same dataset, but are intended to serve different use cases.
