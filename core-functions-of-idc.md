# Core functions

{% hint style="info" %}
IDC is your go-to place for finding and analyzing cancer imaging data in the cloud. While our initial target is radiology data, IDC plans to support digital pathology imaging research and other cancer imaging data types \(subject to prioritization and resources availability, of course!\).
{% endhint %}

### Cloud-based analysis

* Connect cancer researchers with the data and compute resources co-located on the cloud.
* Enable building of imaging-focused cohorts for cross-omics analyses.

### FAIR science

* Implement and refine FAIR \(Findable Accessible Interoperable Reusable\) data stewardship principles as applied to cancer imaging research.
* Apply DICOM standard to harmonize imaging and image-derived cancer imaging data.
* Define best practices and worked out examples for using and generating FAIR data.

### Use cases

* Apply the developed technology to solve meaningful research problems in radiology, digital pathology, and other domains.
* Examples of harmonization of images, image-derived, and image-related data.

### Open source

* Simplify access to open source image computing tools.
* Support adoption of IDC-developed tools.

### Community building

* Identify and address unmet needs of the cancer imaging community.
* Openness, support, and education.
