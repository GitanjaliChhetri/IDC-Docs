#### Introduction

The Web Application provides a GUI through which users can create cohorts of cases and images, view images, and 
export manifests. It runs on Django in a custom AppEngine Flex deployment, and uses CloudSQL, BigQuery, 
and Apache Solr for data access and storage.

The Web Applicationâ€™s code is housed in the IDC-WebApp repository. This contains all files necessary to run the Web 
Application except those documented in GCS buckets section of setup, which must be provided separately.

* A sample version of the .env file is available in the repository as sample.env, and can be used as a starting point for that file.
* A sample version of the deployment configuration text file is available in the repository as sample_deployment_config.txt, and can be used as a starting point for that file. 
* The .sh files in /shell are the scripts used by CircleCI to prep and carry out the build
* The CircleCI YAML file, config.yml, is housed in the .circleci folder and controls the build process using the .sh scripts
* The Dockerfile is part of the repository, and used to perform some final configuration and setup.
