#### 5.1.1 GSuite

* The IDC uses Google GSuite to create an “Organization” that owns all the Google Cloud Projects 
  that are part of the IDC. Furthermore, it allows us to create Google IDs where password 
  lengths and two-factor authentication requirements can be enforced.
* Two superuser accounts are created in the GSuite organization for administering the GSuite 
  system itself. Then, two accounts are created which have the needed permissions needed 
  to create cloud projects. These two accounts are the owners of the various projects, with 
  other users provided roles, such as Editor, with more limited permissions in those projects.
* The organization structure consists of four folders: Admin, Develop, Production, and Sandboxes.
  Projects are then added to these folders. The “sandbox” projects are used by the team for 
  research and development purposes.
