#### 5.1.2 Google Cloud Storage for the Web Portal
* IDC uses GoogleCloud Storage for two primary tasks related to the web portal:
    * Holding versioned deployment files used to configure the web app
    * Holding static file content used by the web app
* Create the following buckets. Apply your own globally unique prefix _pref_ (e.g. your project name) to your bucket names: 
    * pref-deployment-files-xxx (with xxx as dev, test, prod, uat): 
        * Contains the .env file of environment variables for running the web app 
        * The runtime service account key for the web app 
        * The deployment configuration text file
        and the app.yaml file. This bucket’s name (and subpath if relevant) are specified as a CircleCI environment variable.
    * pref-webapp-static-files-xxx: (with xxx as dev, test, prod, or uat):
        * Will contain all of the web application’s static content (JS, images, CSS, fonts) 
        * This bucket name is specified in the deployment configuration file and the .env deployment file.
* Additionally, a bucket staging<project-name>.appspot.com: contains log files from deployment; this is automatically made by deploying the application.
* Permissions: Set the permissions for those buckets:
    * The service account which will be deploying the web application must have read and write permissions on all of these buckets
    * The webapp-static-files-idc-xxx bucket must be set world readable
* The static files bucket needs to have its CORS policy set
    * The webapp-static-files-idc-xxx bucket must have a CORS policy set on it so the Web Application 
      can make use of it.
    * Create a CORS policy JSON file with the following text.   
      ``  [  {  ``  
              `` `"origin": ["https://xxx-domainName.com/"],``   
              `` `"responseHeader": ["Content-Type"],``  
              `` `"method": ["GET"],``   
              `` `"maxAgeSeconds": 3600``   
      ``  } ]``    
    * Set the CORS policy using the following gcloud command:   
       `` gsutil cors set <JSON file name> gs://webapp-static-files-idc-xxxx``
* Set the configuration file buckets pref-deployment-files-xxx to be versioned, specifying deletion of old versions after 100 versions or 365 days
