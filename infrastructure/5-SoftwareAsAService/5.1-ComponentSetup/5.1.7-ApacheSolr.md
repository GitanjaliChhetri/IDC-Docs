* Install ClamAV and Tenable (described in 5.5)
* Enable SSL and require login and password for use:
    * Require Basic Authentication for Solr and establish a username and password
    * Create a self-signed certificate and PEM file, and add it to the webapp-deployment-files-idc-xxx bucket as solr-ssl.pem
