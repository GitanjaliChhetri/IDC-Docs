#### 5.1.5 CloudSQL

* Create a MySQL 5.7+ database instance with limited IP whitelist (secure only), SSL certificates, 
  and a single empty database. This database will be populated by:
    * Django: Web Application system tables, created during the Django migration process (see below)
    * Metadata: Metadata ETL, performed by the ‘database_bootstrap.py’ script located in the /scripts directory of the repository
* Store the name of the database in the .env variable **DATABASE_NAME**
* Create a set of SSL certificates for external access and whitelist secure IPs.
* Create the following users:
    * `root`: required by MySQL but not used by the IDC
    * `django-user`: used by Django to run the Web Application, stored in .env variable **DATABASE_USER** and **DATABASE_PASSWORD**
    * `dev-user`: used by developers to remotely access the database
    * `api-user`: used by the AppEngine Standard API deployment to access the database
* Set the following database flags, which will stream the general query log into StackDriver:
    * `general_log: on`
    * `log_output: file`
* Record the instance connection name, found on the Overview tab, into the .env variable DATABASE_HOST, in the following format: 
`DATABASE_HOST=/cloudsql/<instance connection name>`
