#### 5.1.3 CircleCI

The IDC components use CircleCI to deploy App Engine services to the cloud. Follow these steps to setup CircleCI

* As a member of the administrative group on the GitHub repositories, sign up for CircleCI and add 
  the GitHub repositories which need to be deployed as projects. Documentation for v2 of CircleCI 
  is here: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/
* Create a CircleCI project which follows the intended deployment branch of the github projects for:
    * WebApp
    * API
    * Cron
    * Throttle Proxy
    * Slim Viewer
    * OHIF Viewer
* Create a checkout key in GitHub for CircleCI to use in checking out the branches
    * Go to the Project settings view
    * Click on the ‘Deploy keys’ link
    * Click on the ‘Add deploy key’ button - this will automatically generate a key pair and add it to GitHub’s Deployment key page for this project
* Within each CircleCI project, create the following environment variables *for each tier*:
    * **DEPLOYMENT_KEY_IDC_XXX:** Base64 encoded string of the deployment key JSON file for the deployer service account (see below)
    * **DEPLOYMENT_BUCKET_IDC_XXX:** the GCS path of the deployment bucket (and subfolder if applicable) which contains files used in web application deployment
    * **DEPLOYMENT_CLIENT_EMAIL_IDC_XXX:** the email address of the deployment service account, as listed in the deployment service account’s JSON keyfile.
    * **DEPLOYMENT_PROJECT_ID_IDC_XXX:** the name of the GCP project which the web application is being deployed to
* Create the **STATIC_COMMIT_CHECK_FILE** variable, which is the name of the text file which will store the hash of the last commit to the repositories static files. This is used to determine if an update was made to the static files, to avoid unnecessary ingress and egress charges. This variable is used for all tiers. A copy of the file need not be placed in the deployment directory, as it will be recorded and uploaded if not found.
