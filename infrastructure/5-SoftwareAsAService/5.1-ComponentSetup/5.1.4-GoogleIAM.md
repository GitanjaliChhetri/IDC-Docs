#### 5.1.4 Google IAM


###### WebApp Service Account
* Create a service account and key which will run the web application. The service account needs to be assigned the following roles:
    * BigQuery Data Viewer
    * BigQuery Job User
    * BigQuery User
    * Cloud SQL Client
    * Logs Writer
    * Pub/Sub Publisher
    * Storage Object Admin
    * Storage Object Creator
* Save the key to the deployment-file GCS bucket, and record the file name in the deployment configuration text file

###### WebApp Service Account
* Create an OAuth2 Client for managing user logins via Google
    * Each tier needs its own OAuth2 Client; at most one is allowed for each project 
    * In the APIs and Services section of the Google Cloud Console, select Credentials, then +Create Credentials
    * If an OAuth consent screen hasn’t been configured for this project, you will be prompted to do so.
    * The necessary scopes are: email, profile, openid
    * The domains are idc-xxx.appspot.com and api-dot-idc-xxx.appspot.com (where xxx is the tier in question)
    * If a consent screen has been configured, you will now be able to choose ‘OAuth Client ID’ from the list of 
      options under +Create Credentials
    * For Application Type, choose ‘Web application’
    * Name the Client ‘OAuth2 Client for IDC Web Application’, and set the following JavaScript origins and redirect URIs:
    * JS origins: http://localhost:8085, https://localhost:8085 , https://idc-dev.appspot.com
    * Redirect URIs: http://localhost:8085/accounts/google/login/callback/, https://localhost:8085/accounts/google/login/callback/, https://idc-dev.appspot.com/accounts/google/login/callback/, https://idc-dev.appspot.com/, http://localhost:8085/, https://localhost:8085/, http://localhost:8085/ohif/callback/, https://localhost:8085/ohif/callback/, https://idc-dev.appspot.com/ohif/callback/, http://localhost:8085/callback, https://idc-dev.appspot.com/callback
    * Save the Client, and add the Client ID to the .env as variable OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID and the secret as OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET


###### WebApp Deployment Service Account
* Create a service account and key for deploying services in this project. The service account needs to be assigned the following roles:
    * App Engine Admin
    * App Engine Deployer
    * Cloud Build Editor
    * Cloud Scheduler Admin
    * Cloud Tasks Queue Admin
    * Service Management Administrator
    * Storage Object Creator
    * Storage Object Viewer
    * Serverless VPC Access User (to deploy Throttle Proxy)
    * Compute Network Admin (to deploy Throttle Proxy)
    * Service Config Editor (to deploy API to custom domain)
    * Service Account User (needs iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission: see below)
    * Storage Admin (to be able to modify viewer bucket metadata)
* Base64 encode the JSON contents of the keyfile: `base64 key.json > key.json.b64`
* Save the base64 encoded key in the CircleCI variable DEPLOYMENT_KEY_IDC_XXX (where XXX is the tier, eg. PROD, TEST, DEV)
* A final required step for the deployer SA is to provide it with a role to use the default App Engine SA, 
which is now required by Google to complete the deployment. 
    * Use the command: 
    `gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT_ID]@appspot.gserviceaccount.com --member serviceAccount:deployer@[PROJECT_ID].iam.gserviceaccount.com --role roles/iam.serviceAccountUser`
