# Welcome!

Imaging Data Commons \(IDC\) is a new node in the [Cancer Research Data Commons \(CRDC\)](https://datacommons.cancer.gov/).

CRDC is being established by the National Cancer Institute as a cloud-based data science infrastructure that provides secure access to a large, comprehensive, and expanding collection of cancer research data.

Other CRDC components include data nodes \(Genomic Data Commons, Proteomics Data Commons, Integrative Canine Data Commons\) and cloud resources that provide computation capabilities \(ISB-CGC, Seven Bridges, and Terra\).

IDC is a cloud-based resource that **connects** researchers with

1. cancer image collections
2. a robust infrastructure that contains imaging data, subject and sample metadata, and experimental metadata from disparate sources
3. resources for searching, identifying, and viewing images, and
4. additional data types contained in other Cancer Research Data Commons nodes.
