# Original vs Derived objects

We differentiate between the _original_ and _derived_ DICOM objects in the IDC portal and discussions of the IDC-hosted data. By Original objects we mean DICOM objects that are produced by image acquisition equipment - MR, CT or PET images fall into this category. By Derived objects we mean those objects that were generated by means of analysis or annotation of the original objects. Those objects can contains, for example, volumetric segmentations of the structures in the original images, or quantitative measurements of the objects in the image.

The search portal of IDC groups attributes that are specific to the original and derived objects.

As discussed earlier, regardless of the specific object type, all DICOM will contain so-called “composite context.” At the patient level, the composite context includes identifying and descriptive attributes such as patient name, ID, age and sex. The study context includes the date and time that the imaging study started, unique identification of the study and other information common to all series in the study. The composite context enables consistent indexing and cross-referencing of the various objects. In addition to shared composite context, derived DICOM objects typically contain explicit references to the “source” objects from which they were derived, which supports recording of the provenance of the object derivation as well as application functionality such as superimposition during rendering.
