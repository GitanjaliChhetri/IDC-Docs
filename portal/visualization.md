Viewing Images in the Imaging Data Commons

We currently highlight the Open Health Imaging Foundation\(OHIF\) as our main tool for visualization of images. OHIF provides extensive support for viewing, annotating, and reporting on DICOM images in 2D \(slices\) and 3D \(volumes\).

Segmentations and Real World Value Mapping object classes can only be viewed at the Study level.
