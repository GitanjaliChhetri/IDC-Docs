# Getting started

IDC data is hosted using standard capabilities of the GCP Storage and BigQuery components. All of the GCP API capabilities provided by GCP to access IDC maintained storage buckets and tables are available to interact with that data.

**IDC API covering functionality which is specific to IDC \(e.g., cohort-related operations\) is currently under development and is not part of the MVP functionality.**

If you have feedback about the desired features of the IDC API, please let us know via [support forum](https://discourse.canceridc.dev).
